# Changelog

All notable changes to Split Node.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-08-04

### Fix: SystemBreakers.bat crash

- Fixed bat crash: unescaped parenthesis in the ComfyUI warning echo ("Start ComfyUI (run_nvidia_gpu.bat)...") terminated the parenthesized IF block early, aborting the batch with "then was unexpected at this time" at the ComfyUI check
- Removed `setlocal enabledelayedexpansion` (it was unused) - exclamation marks in echo text were being swallowed as delayed-expansion references
- Rewritten with CRLF line endings (cmd.exe parses multi-line parenthesized blocks reliably with CRLF)
- Verified end-to-end through cmd.exe: all checks, warn paths and the launch flow complete without errors

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-04

### Brand & AI logos - official sources first

- Official logo registry (`OFFICIAL_LOGOS`): 36 brands pre-mapped to their Wikimedia Commons logo files - all AI companies (OpenAI, Google/Gemini, Anthropic, Meta, Microsoft/Copilot, xAI/Grok, Mistral, DeepSeek, Stability AI, Midjourney, Runway, Hugging Face, ElevenLabs, Perplexity, Adobe/Firefly, NVIDIA) plus frequently-mentioned big tech (Apple, Amazon, IBM, Tesla, Netflix, Spotify, LinkedIn, Oracle, Sony, Ford, Toyota, Coca-Cola, X, Salesforce, Nike)
- `_commons_logo_bytes`: fetches the official mark via the Commons API, rasterized to a 512px PNG thumbnail (SVG sources rendered server-side - no local converter needed), with a proper User-Agent
- `_find_logo` priority order: cache -> official Wikimedia -> SerpAPI image search (Openverse fallback) ONLY for brands not in the official registry
- Verified live: OpenAI + Tesla resolve from Wikimedia; a non-registry business (Patagonia) falls back to SerpAPI

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-04

Initial release - the complete AI documentary generator pipeline.

### Story discovery

- RSS "beat the system" story ingestion (hack / lottery / loophole keywords) with junk-article filtering (cookie / newsletter / paywall / sponsored / boilerplate patterns stripped before paragraph extraction)
- LLM relevance scoring for every paragraph vs the overall topic (0-10, off-topic beats discarded) with fail-open keep-on-error behavior
- Trend scoring toolkit (`trend_scorer.py`): SerpAPI demand data + YouTube competition analysis, cached 24h

### Script generation (LLM)

- **Director's bible** (`_build_directors_bible`): deeper problem, protagonist transformation, chapter moods, hero paragraphs for ECU magnification - the plan before any image
- **Episode world** context builder - works for any topic / environment / location
- **Scene board** (`_build_scene_board`): one storyboard card per narration beat, saved to the episode folder for human review before generation
- **Stage 1 - narration script** (`_build_narration_script`): each article paragraph expanded into multiple narration paragraphs, target ~115 total for ~25 min episodes; covered-beat dedupe list injected per call to prevent repetition
- **Stage 1 hardening**: strict OUTPUT CONTRACT (raw narration only - no "Here are 5 paragraphs" meta text), `_strip_narration_meta` gate applied before TTS and at parse, bad-generation retry
- **Stage 2 - shot list** (`_build_shot_list`): one shot entry per narration paragraph - mannequin archetype, camera logic (EWS / WS / MS / CU / ECU), angle, action, SFX category; chapter paragraphs become black cards
- **Chapter system**: 10 duration-aligned breaks (intro/outro 15% each, middle even) estimated from per-paragraph word counts, LLM-written chapter titles (`_llm_chapter_titles`)
- **Style test frame + human review gate**: Krea 2 test frame generated before the run commits; rejection rebuilds the bible with a fresh perspective
- **Episode template**: the winning formula (bible + setup) saved per episode for reuse

### Cast & likeness

- 20 fixed metahuman archetypes (`CHARACTER_ROSTER`) with exact clothing prompts; `_assign_archetype` maps characters by role keywords + gender/age with everyman fallback
- Real-photo reference search via SerpAPI Google Images (~$0.01/query) with Openverse fallback, downloaded to `cast_refs/real/` (gitignored)
- Local LM Studio vision audit (`_audit_real_photo`): person present + text/logo/watermark rejection
- Krea 2 identity LoRA chains: 6-panel character sheets (face -> face-side -> face-back -> body-front -> body-side -> body-back), face-lock portraits, angle-matched views in shots
- Identity prompt fixes: view-description-only prompts (style text in identity prompts flips the model into img2img copy mode); grounding tuned to 768px (1024px caused split/duplicate figures)

### Assets & style chain

- Channel style sheet (`build_style_sheet.py`, Arcane reference) as the single source of truth for the look - no LoRA training
- Dedicated location style sheets (`build_asset_style_sheets.py`): 6-panel 3x2 grids per environment (establishing / front-left / front-right / interior / detail / overhead)
- Prop assets: front + back panels; generic props pure text-to-image with style plate, specific real-world props (brands / models / digits / proper nouns via `_needs_real_prop`) get SerpAPI real photo + style plate; `PROP_REAL_FORCE` overrides
- Style-transfer-only prompt wording ("Use ONLY the painting and render style from the reference artwork") - assets are styled, shots reference ONLY the styled assets (plate as fallback only)
- B-roll cache (`_lookup_broll_asset` / `_cache_broll_asset`, `generate_broll_cache.py`): reusable no-character shots keyed by scene keywords

### Brand & AI logos

- Curated AI company/model registry (OpenAI, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Midjourney, NVIDIA, xAI, DeepSeek, ElevenLabs...) with alias-based detection across the article + narration
- LLM business extraction pass (`_extract_brands`): any other real businesses mentioned get detected and classified as `screen` (entity/product talk) or `building` (HQ / offices / factory / physical location talk); manifest persisted to `cast_refs/logos/brands.json`
- Logo cache (`cast_refs/logos/`): SerpAPI image search (Openverse fallback) downloads the official logo once, then it is reused forever - cache-first, zero repeat searches; `--cache-logos NAME` CLI pre-caches without a full run
- Hacker-screen assets (`image-assets/brand_screens/`): entity talk renders a dark hacker terminal with the real logo centered, refs = [prop style sheet, logo]
- Logo-on-building assets (`image-assets/brand_buildings/`): HQ talk renders the logo as a glowing facade sign at night, refs = [location style sheet, logo]
- Business-building location sheets: when a location IS a business building (e.g. "OpenAI headquarters", "Tesla factory floor"), the logo joins that sheet's refs so it appears inside the generated building
- Shot matching: scenes mentioning a brand pick the screen asset (entity talk) or building asset (HQ words in the scene); brand-name props use the cached logo as their real reference
- Resume-safe: brand assets rebuild from disk caches + manifest, no re-extraction needed

### Imagery

- Local Krea 2 Turbo generation (`krea2_splitnode.py`, ComfyUI --lowvram, identity LoRA `krea2_identity_edit_v1_2_r128`)
- Shots composed from pre-styled refs (face panel + location sheet + prop asset + b-roll), no style plate in shots
- Image generation runs in parallel with TTS (background worker)

### Voice, music & SFX

- PocketTTS narration voice (built-in or cloned ref), loudnorm 0dB
- Music: one continuous bed - suspense for the first 65% crossfading (2s) into triumphant, mixed at -18dB
- SFX library (`cinematic_sounds/`, Nikko Hunt) with pre-analyzed build / hit / decay times (`analyze_sfx.py` -> `sfx_library_extra.json`), hit-aligned at -14dB
- Camera shutter SFX at -4dB on cuts; every video opens with a glitchy suspense hit at t=0

### Rendering & titles

- 1080p hevc_nvenc with stream-copy concat and `+faststart` / `avoid_negative_ts`
- Chapter cards: "CHAPTER N" kicker + title, both ASS dialogs in Bahnschrift with glow-pop; typewriter location/person cards in Consolas (1.5s type / 4s hold / glitch off), pinned to faster-whisper word timings
- SPANkendata 4x upscaler (`upscale_4k.py`): bf16 + channels_last (fp16 corrupts SPAN arch), streaming raw RGB frames to GPU instead of per-frame PNG I/O

### YouTube & Discord

- YouTube upload with native scheduling, per-channel credentials, AI-generated content disclaimer
- Discord announcement after every upload (video description + hype wrap + link, Cloudflare 403 UA fix)

### Reliability & testing

- Resume-safe stages with saved state (story -> images -> render -> upload), persistent batch clips with reuse + cleanup
- Test suite: style sheet tests, identity chain tests (full chain, prod identity), sheet-to-shot, shot angles, style assets, end-to-end mini test (`mini_test.py`)

### Security & ops

- `.env`, `client_secret_*.json`, `*.credentials.json` gitignored - API keys never committed
- Real-person likeness photos (`cast_refs/real/`) gitignored - privacy / copyright
- README showcase images committed under `docs/images/` (optimized copies)
